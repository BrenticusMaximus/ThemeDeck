## Release Updates

## February 27, 2026 Update (v2.5.2)

This update gives users finer control over when game music stops playing: at launch start or at launch finish. It also adds a dedicated store-track enable/disable control.

## February 25, 2026 Update (v2.5.1)

This update fixes a critical launch-state issue by ensuring ThemeDeck never plays global/ambient music or game-page theme music while a game is running.

## February 25, 2026 Update (v2.5.0)

This update adds bulk auto-assign for games without music, a "Show games without music" list with live name-resolution progress, and improved game ID handling to reduce duplicate/alias entries.

## February 25, 2026 Update (v2.4.2)

This update prevents global/ambient auto-play while you are inside ThemeDeck assignment pages, so global music no longer plays when selecting or assigning per-game tracks.

## February 24, 2026 Update (v2.4.1)

This update ensures ThemeDeck never plays any music tracks while Steam is in Desktop Mode.

## February 24, 2026 Update (v2.4.0)

This update adds an optional **store-only music track** that plays only on Steam Store pages, with independent preview, volume, remove, and truncate-start controls.

## February 23, 2026 Update (v2.3.0)

This update adds an optional **global/ambient music track** for non-game pages, including its own individual volume setting and playback controls.

## February 21, 2026 Update (v2.2.0)

This update allows users to attach ThemeDeck music for games that are not installed yet. If a game has a Steam game page, users can now assign music and have it play there.

## February 21, 2026 Update (v2.1.0)

This update adds a per-game **Truncate beginning of song** setting (0-30 seconds) in ThemeDeck settings. This lets users skip silent intros by starting each assigned track at a custom offset.

## February 19, 2026 Update (v2.0.0)

This update adds **YouTube search/download support powered by `yt-dlp`** so users can search game music, preview tracks, download locally, and assign directly from ThemeDeck. You still have the option to manually assign local music tracks.
